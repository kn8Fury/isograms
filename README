This purpose of this project is to read words from a source file,
find isograms, and store them in appropiately named files.

Two source files are available in this project:
	1. The Project Gutenberg EBook of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary
	2. 'words.txt' available at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (renamed to
	'words_git.txt'

'webster.py' is used to read only the words from Webster's Dictionary and
write them to 'words_webster.txt'

'isograms.py' is used to write isograms from the source file to appropiately
named files.
